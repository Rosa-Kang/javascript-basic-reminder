Javascript Basics Reminder
Build interactive web application.

Every browsers have Javascript engine that can run JS. Javascript engine in FF and Chrome are Spider Monkey and V8.  

In 2009, R. D took the open source of js engine in chrome and embedded inside c++ program. So Node is c++ program that includes google’s v8, js engine. 

So Js can now run on browser and node. Browser and Node provide runtime environment for JS.

- [x] ECMA Script vs Javascript ?
:ECMA Script is just a specification and JS is a programming language.
In 2015, they released EC2015/ES6 and we’re using JS ES6 according to the specification.

- [x] Best Practice : add your script at the end of the body tag.

Javascript Variable
Rule1. Should be meaningful
Rule2. Cannot be a reserved keyword
Rule3. They cannot start with a number
Rule4. They cannot contain space or hyphen (ex. let firstName)
Rule5. They are case-sensitive
 
Javascript Constant
If you need to re-assign variable, use let, and if you don’t want to re-assign, use const.


|Javascript Data Type|
1. Primitives/Value Types.
:String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null and Symbol(ES6)

2. Reference Types
Objects, Arrays, Functions

|Static Languages vs Dynamic Languages|
One thing that separates JS from other languages is JS is a dynamic language. A type of variable can change at run-time in JS.

|Javascript Object|
We can reference an Object so the code is cleaner.

|Javascript Arrays|
Argument is the input value and the parameter of the function at the time of declaration.
